# Traveler Generator
This is a tool written in python used for generating the folder structure and sample travellers for BIRDSHOT.

To install, download the project and extract it to a folder. Make sure you have Python 3.10.8 installed. For the current version of the project, the dependencies are not included, so you will need to open a command bar and use the `python3 pip install openpyxl` and `python3 -pip install PIL` commands to install them. 

This project relies on Google's Drive application to sync files on your computer to the cloud. Install Google's Drive app at https://www.google.com/drive/download/. Once installed and signed in, open the `config.ini` file and set the default directory to point to the folder in your Google Drive.
